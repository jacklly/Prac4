# Reflection

## Estimates:
- My estimates over the course of the practical tasks were somewhat accurate, however, I would sometimes either give myself too high of a time schedule, or do the activity over 2 days; leading to discrepancies as it was difficult to calculate the time taken.

## Code Reviews:
- Completing code reviews was a helpful task as it allowed for me to not only practice looking over others' code, but enabled me to see what I could have done better myself, hence leading to the betterment of my code as well.

## Practical Tasks:
- Overall I think the practical tasks are a good balance of simple and more advanced activities which challenge students to better use knowledge they already have, thusly, I probably wouldn't change anything.
